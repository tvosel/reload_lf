# {repo_name}

A simulation of a robust event listener component for a cross-chain bridge. This Python script demonstrates the architectural patterns required to reliably listen for on-chain events on a source blockchain and trigger corresponding actions on a destination blockchain.

This project is designed as an architectural showcase, simulating blockchain interactions without requiring a live RPC endpoint. It highlights best practices such as state management, error handling, and modular design.

## Concept

Cross-chain bridges allow users to transfer assets or data from one blockchain to another. A critical component of any bridge is the 'relayer' or 'oracle' network that monitors the source chain for specific events and relays them to the destination chain.

This script simulates such a component. Its primary function is to:
1.  **Monitor** a `Bridge` smart contract on a source chain.
2.  **Listen** for a `TokensLocked` event, which is emitted when a user deposits assets into the bridge.
3.  **Parse** the event data to understand who locked the tokens, what kind, how much, and for which destination chain.
4.  **Relay** this information to a destination chain by simulating the submission of a new transaction (e.g., a `mint` transaction to issue wrapped tokens to the user).

## Code Architecture

The script is structured into several distinct classes, each with a single responsibility, to ensure modularity and testability.

```

-   `MockBlockchainConnector`: Simulates a connection to a blockchain's JSON-RPC endpoint. It generates a stream of mock blocks and events, removing the need for a live Ganache instance or public testnet connection. This makes the simulation self-contained.
-   `EventParser`: Takes raw log data (as provided by an RPC node) and decodes it into a human-readable, structured format using a predefined contract ABI.
-   `TransactionRelayer`: Simulates the action of creating, signing, and broadcasting a transaction on the destination chain. It includes simulated latency and failure modes.
-   `StateDB`: Manages persistent state in a simple `state.json` file. It's responsible for tracking the last block number processed and which events have already been handled, ensuring the listener can resume from where it left off and avoid duplicate processing.
-   `CrossChainBridgeListener`: The core class that orchestrates the entire process. It contains the main polling loop, coordinates the other components, and handles high-level logic like batching and handling block confirmations.

## How it Works

The listener operates in a continuous polling loop:

1.  **Initialization**: On startup, the listener initializes all components and connects to the (simulated) source and destination chain RPC endpoints.
2.  **State Loading**: It loads its previous state from `state.json` using the `StateDB` class. This tells it which block to start scanning from.
3.  **Polling Loop**: The listener enters an infinite loop, periodically checking for new blocks.
4.  **Block Confirmation**: To protect against blockchain re-organizations (reorgs), it does not process the absolute latest block. Instead, it waits for a certain number of blocks (`CONFIRMATIONS_REQUIRED`) to pass, ensuring the events it processes are on a finalized block.
5.  **Event Fetching**: For the confirmed block range, it calls the `MockBlockchainConnector` to fetch all logs that match the bridge contract's address and the `TokensLocked` event signature.
6.  **Parsing & Deduplication**: Each fetched log is parsed by the `EventParser`. A unique hash for the event is generated, and the `StateDB` is checked to ensure it hasn't been processed before.
7.  **Transaction Relaying**: For each new, valid event, the `TransactionRelayer` is invoked to simulate the corresponding transaction on the destination chain.
8.  **State Persistence**: After successfully processing a batch of blocks, the `CrossChainBridgeListener` instructs the `StateDB` to update the `last_processed_block` number and save the state to disk.
9.  **Graceful Shutdown**: If the process is interrupted (e.g., with Ctrl+C), it catches the signal, saves its current state, and exits cleanly.

## Usage Example

Follow these steps to run the simulation.

**1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd {repo_name}
```

**2. Set up a virtual environment**
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

**3. Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Configure environment variables (Optional)**
The script uses default mock RPC URLs. You can override them via environment variables if you wish to modify the simulation parameters.
```bash
export SOURCE_CHAIN_RPC="https://mock.source.chain.rpc"
export DEST_CHAIN_RPC="https://mock.dest.chain.rpc"
```

**5. Run the script**
```bash
python script.py
```

**Expected Output**
You will see log messages indicating the listener's activity, such as connecting to chains, scanning blocks, and processing simulated events.
